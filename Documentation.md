# BookApp API Documentation

## Overview

The BookApp API allows users and administrators to interact with the application for managing books and user accounts. It supports functionalities like user login, book management, and admin actions.

## Error Handling

-   **400 Bad Request:** Invalid request data.
-   **401 Unauthorized:** Invalid or missing authentication token.
-   **404 Not Found:** Resource not found.
-   **500 Internal Server Error:** Server-side error.

## **1. Installation and Setup**

### **1.1. Composer Install**

First, make sure you have Composer installed on your system. Then, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

### **1.2. Environment Configuration**

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to configure your database and other environment-specific settings.

### **1.3. Generate Application Key**

To generate a unique application key, run:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
```

This command will set the `APP_KEY` value in your `.env` file, which is used for encryption.

### **1.4. Migrate Database**

Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

### **1.5. Run Database Seeders**

If your application includes seeders to populate the database with initial data, you can run them using:

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

This command will execute the `DatabaseSeeder` class, which can call other seeders to fill your database with test data.

### **1.6. Install Laravel Passport**

To install Laravel Passport for API authentication, use the following command:

```sh
php artisan passport:install
```

This command will create the encryption keys needed to generate secure access tokens.

## **2. Optimization**

To optimize the application for better performance, you can run the following command:

```sh
php artisan optimize
```

This command clears and caches routes, config, views, and more.

## **3. Running the Application**

To serve the application locally, you can use Laravel's built-in development server:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

This command will start the development server at `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can specify a different host and port if needed:

```sh
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8080
```

## **4. Additional Commands**

### **4.1. Clear Cached Configurations**

To clear cached configurations, use:

```sh
php artisan config:clear
```

### **4.2. Clear Cached Routes**

To clear cached routes, use:

```sh
php artisan route:clear
```

### **4.3. Clear Compiled Views**

To clear compiled views, use:

```sh
php artisan view:clear
```
